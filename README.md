# Soil_moisture_regrid_UM
A collection of sbatch and python scripts for regridding soil moisture output from the Met Office Unified Model (UM) on ARCHER. These scripts are focused on working with the Limited Area Model version of the UM. These scripts should support those running high-resolution simulations which are bounded by ERA5.
